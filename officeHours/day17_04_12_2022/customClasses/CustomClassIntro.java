    What is CLASS ?

    - Blueprint / Template for OBJECT
    - We can create CLass without OBJECT

          Arrays.toString();   // toString is static method

     What is OBJECT ?


     - Instance of the CLASS
     - Objects consumes  memories in heap
     - We can t create an OBJECT without CLASS

     Car                 c                          =        new                           Car();

     Class              Reference Var / Object Name      keyword to create new OBJECT      Constructor






     */

     String instanceVariable;   //  null

    /*
    What is instanceVar ?

    - BELONGS TO OBJECTS ( Each Object has their own copy )
    - it needs to be created outside of any methods (should be in class )
    - Attributes / datas / field
    - Init is not mandatory (Default values like null,0,0.0,false etc )

    How can we access them ?

    - We need to create one OBJECT to access them ( variable / methods )

      Car c =new Car();
      c.instanceVariable="BMW";   // change- assign value
      sout(c);   -- it will print whole object information
      sout(c.instanceVariable) -- to print only instance

        What is instanceMethod ?

        - Instance Methods can access instance Variable and Methods


           Car c =new Car();
           c.instanceMethod();   // to call instance method from OBJECT
