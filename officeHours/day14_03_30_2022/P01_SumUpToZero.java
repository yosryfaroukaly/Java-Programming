           Task 3:  Write a method that,
                       given an integer N (1 < N < 100), returns an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0.
                        The method can return any such array.
                        For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1,0, -3,2] or [-2,1, -4,5].
                        The answer [1, -1,1,3] would be incorrect (because value 1 occurs twice).
                        For N = 3 one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1] (but there are many more correct answers).
